\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 Good Design:\
\

\b0 - https://www.gov.uk/\
- https://fonts.google.com/\
- https://www.zillow.com/\
\
	All three of these websites feature sleek design that is convenient, appealing, and most importantly, easy to use and navigate. My favorite out of these three websites is the first, gov.uk. The most important thing about a website is analyzing the audience, and making sure they can effectively use the website. For gov.uk, the audience is the entire population of the United Kingdom, meaning the website should be simple, fast, and convenient. Unlike most government websites, gov.uk, is extremely fast, and straight to the point. The entire website uses the same font, and separates important data by color and through bold and underlined phrases; consequently, it makes the website easy to navigate, and it doesn\'92t distract through fancy photos or animations. When I lived in Mexico City, to go through any bureaucratic process I had to navigate through gob.mx, which is extremely slow due to the number of photos and animations featured on the website. While gov.uk is not visually appealing, its minimalism and comfort makes it the best website possible for any government institution. No one likes engaging in government processes, but this website makes sure you spend the least amount of time enduring those tasks. \
	Google fonts recently updated their website, and it is now the perfect layout for finding fonts. On the right side of the website there are checklists to refine the fonts you\'92re looking for, and when you select or deselect certain characteristics, rather than refreshing the entire page, it merely updates the fonts on the main section of the page. The minimalist design ensures that you only focus on the fonts they offer, and it is the perfect size to refine a search and pick a font you need for the task at hand. Lastly, all the fonts are featured on the same page, so you can scroll endlessly and update characteristics for the fonts and you\'92ll stay on the same section of the page. \
	Finally, zillow.com is the best website available for real estate in the United States. Out of all three of these websites, Zillow is the clunkiest and slowest, only because it has to load a lot more information than the other two websites. When you search for a location in the United States, zillow provides a map on the left side of the screen, and a list of properties on the right side, and when you move the map it updates the list of properties available. Furthermore, on the top of the screen you can adjust characteristics of the properties such as the number of bedrooms, the price, the home type, listing type, etc. When looking for apartments in New York City, I went through many websites, but none were as effective as Zillow, and since websites have to load hundreds of properties in Manhattan, Zillow is the only website that can effectively manage the large number of data. Lastly, Zillow makes it extremely easy to navigate from property to property, contact real estate agents, enquire about properties, and add properties to your favorites; therefore, Zillow allows you to navigate between multitudes of possibilities of data in an easy and convenient way, making this one of my favorite designs on the internet.   \

\b Bad Design:\
\

\b0 - https://www.sears.com/\
- https://www.yahoo.com/\
- https://www.breitbart.com/\
\
	Sears.com, the first website on my list, is a clear example of one of the reasons Sears failed to succeed in the retail market. The design of the website throws a large amount of information at your face, in huge font with different colors, yet fails to highlight differences in content and important information. The website is wildly extravagant, and the use of all caps on the photos makes it almost impossible to browse the site without getting a headache. The content isn\'92t placed in an organized manner, and it is very difficult for a user to discern the appropriate information on the main page of the website. \
	Yahoo has a similar problem, since it diverts from the minimalist design featured by other search engines. While the design is not that bad compared to other websites, as a search engine, the design makes no sense, and deters people from using Yahoo as their go to search engine. The news articles are clumped up in a large bunch, and it makes it hard to focus on one headline when they are all next to each-other, the website should do a better job at categorizing and differentiating different types of information, such as weather and the scoreboard; furthermore, the search engine should be focused on one web page, since it forces people to read headlines when they are merely trying to browse the internet. \
	Lastly, breitbart.com, which should be no surprise, features extravagant design that is almost impossible to read. At first glance, the margins at the side of the page are huge, leaving a lot of blank space that makes the reader wonder why the content is secluded to the middle of the page. Also, there are too many differences in color, font, font size, and font style to focus on any one element on the webpage. The use of all caps for headlines makes it seem like every news article is breaking news, when it actually shows clickbait and other unassuming news stories. Like the other websites, Breitbart should organize the content in a more discrete manner, since scrolling through this webpage is painful.  \
